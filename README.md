## Project Description
This project is a simple "Spin The Bottle" game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game allows users to add player names to a list and spin a virtual bottle to randomly select one of the players.

## Features

- Prevent adding duplicate player names.
- Spin the bottle to randomly select a player.
- Update the status message based on the game actions.

## Files
- index.html: The HTML structure of the project.
- script.js: The JavaScript logic for adding players and spinning the bottle.

## Setup and Usage
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Open index.html in your web browser.
- Enter player names in the input field and click "Add player".

## Conclusion
I got stuck for a long time on the part where I had to add the players to the list. It was actually adding them to the players list, but I could not pass the test. 
I eventually resorted to ChatGPT for the answer, which found a different way but I am still unsure why my first way didn't work.
